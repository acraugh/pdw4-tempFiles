# pdw4-tempFiles
Work-in-progress examples for 4th Planetary Data Workshop (June 2019)

These files are posted temporarily (they will be taken down by mid-July) to illustrate the process described in my PDW4 talk "Designing a PDS4 Data Dictionary".  They are part of a project I'm currently working on: migrating Rosetta PDS3 mission data to PDS4.  The sample files are related to the navigational camera (NAVCAM) data sets, which are only moderately complicated.
